# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project is a group assignment for university studies. It focuses on performing a statistical analysis of the classic Iris dataset, providing insights into species distributions, feature characteristics, and relationships between different attributes.

## Features

- **Species Distribution Analysis**
  - Computes the count and percentage share of each species.
- **Feature Distribution Analysis**
  - Calculates key statistical measures for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width:
    - Minimum and maximum values
    - Arithmetic mean
    - Median
    - First (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles
    - Standard deviation
- **Data Visualization**
  - Histograms for each feature (combined across all species)
  - Box plots for each feature (segmented by species)
- **Feature Relationship Analysis**
  - Computes Pearson’s correlation coefficient for each pair of features
  - Determines linear regression equations
  - Generates scatter plots with regression lines

## Output

The program generates:

- A summary table of species distributions.
- A statistical summary of feature distributions.
- Histograms and box plots for feature visualization.
- Scatter plots with regression lines, including Pearson’s correlation coefficients and regression equations.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Each sample includes four numerical features:

1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)
